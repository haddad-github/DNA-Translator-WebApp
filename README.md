# DNA-to-RNA-Translator-WEB
Link: https://biotranslator.herokuapp.com/translate
### Currently translates an input of a DNA sequence into an mRNA and into a protein sequence.

## Potential features to come
1) Choose which ORF to translate by
2) Possibility to upload a FASTA file and receive a downloadable and a copy-to-clipboard translated version
3) Database queries with Uniprot/NCBI

### How it works:
You start by entering a DNA sequence (be it in lowercase or uppercase, it takes both).

Click "Translate" and you're found with the transcribed to mRNA and to protein.
